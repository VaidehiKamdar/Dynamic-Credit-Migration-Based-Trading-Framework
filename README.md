This project introduces a dynamic daily credit scoring framework that integrates the Kealhofer-Merton-Vasicek (KMV) model and Hidden Markov Models (HMM). The KMV model is used to estimate the Distance-to-Default and Probability of Default for 15 companies, using historical market data including equity value, short-term debt, and long-term debt. The Hidden Markov Model (HMM) then models credit rating transitions as a probabilistic state-switching process, using the KMV model outputs along with macroeconomic indicators such as CDS spreads, inflation rates, and treasury yields. Additionally, financial ratios are used to derive a financial health score, providing a comprehensive view of each company's financial stability. A dynamic credit score is then calculated, combining the financial health score with the normalized outputs from the HMM, using the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). This dynamic credit score is then applied in a hedged trading strategy involving credit default swaps (CDS) and equities, enabling long/short trades based on predicted regime-switching probabilities. The strategy's effectiveness lies in its ability to balance idiosyncratic and systemic risks, achieving high risk-adjusted returns.
